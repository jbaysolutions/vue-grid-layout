# vue-grid-layout

vue-grid-layout is a grid layout system, like [Gridster](http://dsmorse.github.io/gridster.js/), for Vue.js. **Heavily inspired in [React-Grid-Layout](https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout)**

### **Current version:** 2.1.9 (Supports Vue 2.2+)

### **For Vue 2.1.10 and below use version [2.1.3](https://github.com/jbaysolutions/vue-grid-layout/tree/2.1.3)**
### **For Vue 1 use version [1.0.3](https://github.com/jbaysolutions/vue-grid-layout/tree/1.0.3)**

### Events

Move and resize event listeners can be added to each grid-item, so that the parent Vue can be notified when a grid element is being moved or resized.
Moved and resized event listeners can be added, if the only notification needed is when an item is finished moving or resizing.

Working example [here](https://jbaysolutions.github.io/vue-grid-layout/examples/02-events.html)

````html
<grid-layout
  :layout="layout"
  :col-num="12"
  :row-height="30"
  :is-draggable="true"
  :is-resizable="true"
  :vertical-compact="true"
  :margin="[10, 10]"
  :use-css-transforms="true"
>
  <grid-item
    v-for="item in layout"
    :key="item.i"
    :x="item.x"
    :y="item.y"
    :w="item.w"
    :h="item.h"
    :i="item.i"
    @init="initEvent"
    @resize="resizeEvent"
    @move="moveEvent"
    @resized="resizedEvent"
    @moved="movedEvent">
    {{item.i}}
  </grid-item>
</grid-layout>
````

* Initial event: an item is initialed

```javascript
  /**
   *
   * @param i the item id/index
   * @param H height in grid rows
   * @param W width in grid columns
   * @param HPx height in pixels
   * @param WPx width in pixels
   *
   */
  initEvent: function(i, H, W, HPx, WPx){
      console.log("INITIALED i=" + i + ", H=" + H + ", W=" + W + ", H(px)=" + HPx + ", W(px)=" + WPx);
  },
```

* Move event: every time an item is being moved and changes position

```javascript
  moveEvent: function(i, newX, newY){
      console.log("MOVE i=" + i + ", X=" + newX + ", Y=" + newY);
  },
```

* Resize event: every time an item is being resized and changes size

```javascript
  resizeEvent: function(i, newH, newW){
      console.log("RESIZE i=" + i + ", H=" + newH + ", W=" + newW);
  },
```

* Moved event: every time an item is finished being moved and changes position

```javascript
  movedEvent: function(i, newX, newY){
      console.log("MOVED i=" + i + ", X=" + newX + ", Y=" + newY);
  },
```

* Resized event: every time an item is finished being resized and changes size

```javascript
  /**
   *
   * @param i the item id/index
   * @param newH new height in grid rows
   * @param newW new width in grid columns
   * @param newHPx new height in pixels
   * @param newWPx new width in pixels
   *
   */
  resizedEvent: function(i, newH, newW, newHPx, newWPx){
      console.log("RESIZED i=" + i + ", H=" + newH + ", W=" + newW + ", H(px)=" + newHPx + ", W(px)=" + newWPx);
  },
```
