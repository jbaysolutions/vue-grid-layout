# vue-grid-layout

vue-grid-layout is a grid layout system, like [Gridster](http://dsmorse.github.io/gridster.js/), for Vue.js. **Heavily inspired in [React-Grid-Layout](https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout)**

### **Current version:** 2.1.13 (Supports Vue 2.2+)

### **For Vue 2.1.10 and below use version [2.1.3](https://github.com/jbaysolutions/vue-grid-layout/tree/2.1.3)**
### **For Vue 1 use version [1.0.3](https://github.com/jbaysolutions/vue-grid-layout/tree/1.0.3)**

#### Events

Move and resize event listeners can be added to each grid-item, so that the parent Vue can be notified when a grid element is being moved or resized.
Moved and resized event listeners can be added, if the only notification needed is when an item is finished moving or resizing.

Working example [here](https://jbaysolutions.github.io/vue-grid-layout/examples/02-events.html)
